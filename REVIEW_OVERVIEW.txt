# LIKE-MINES: ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW & FUTURE ROADMAP
# Senior Developer Handoff Document
# Generated: 2025-08-14

## PROJECT STATUS & CONTEXT

**Current State**: The codebase has undergone successful incremental refactoring from a 1200+ line main.ts monolith to a modular architecture. The game is functional with working character selection, board mechanics, shop system, upgrade progression, and AI opponent.

**Total Codebase**: ~6,300 lines across 25 TypeScript modules
**Architecture Pattern**: Event-driven with centralized store, Canvas-based rendering
**Build System**: Vite + TypeScript, minimal dependencies (rot-js for procedural generation)

---

## ARCHITECTURAL STRENGTHS

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns** - Recent refactoring successfully extracted:
   - Event handling (global, canvas, button handlers)
   - UI widgets (clues, shop, inventory, upgrades)
   - Game logic separation from presentation
   - Hover state management centralization

2. **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript types in types.ts covering all game entities
3. **Modular Structure** - Each file has single responsibility, easy to reason about
4. **Canvas Rendering** - Custom renderer handles complex game state visualization efficiently
5. **Store Pattern** - Centralized state management with observer pattern for UI reactivity

---

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DEBT

### üö® High-Priority Issues

#### 1. **MONOLITHIC STORE** (store.ts - 1,510 lines)
**Problem**: The store.ts file is now the largest in the codebase and handles everything from game logic to UI state to AI coordination. It violates single responsibility principle.

**Impact**: 
- Difficult to test individual game mechanics
- Tight coupling between unrelated systems
- Performance issues (entire UI re-renders on any state change)
- Maintenance nightmare as game complexity grows

**Recommended Solution**: 
```
Store Decomposition Strategy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GameState (core game rules, board state)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UIState (hover, selections, modals)  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PlayerState (inventory, stats, upgrades)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MatchState (turn management, AI coordination)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MetaState (character selection, run progression)
```

#### 2. **RENDER-HEAVY ARCHITECTURE**
**Problem**: Every state change triggers full UI rebuild via render() cascade.

**Impact**: Performance degradation, unnecessary DOM manipulation, poor UX on lower-end devices.

**Solution**: Implement granular reactivity - components only update when their specific data changes.

#### 3. **TESTING VOID**
**Problem**: Zero test coverage. No unit tests, integration tests, or architectural testing patterns.

**Impact**: Refactoring is risky, bugs are discovered in production, hard to verify game balance changes.

**Solution**: Implement testing pyramid:
- Unit tests for game logic (pure functions)
- Integration tests for store/renderer interactions  
- End-to-end tests for core player flows

---

## STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

### üîß Medium-Priority Refactoring

#### 1. **Event System Overhaul**
Current ad-hoc event handling should become a formal event bus:
```typescript
// Instead of: renderer.clearAllHighlights(); updateUI(); render()
// Do: eventBus.emit('highlights:clear', { tiles: [...] })
```

**Benefits**: Decoupling, easier debugging, plugin architecture potential

#### 2. **Component Architecture**
Extract UI widgets into proper components with lifecycle:
```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CluesPanel/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InventoryPanel/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ShopModal/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ GameBoard/
```

**Benefits**: Reusability, isolated testing, cleaner prop interfaces

#### 3. **Game Logic Extraction**
Move pure game mechanics out of store into dedicated services:
- `CombatSystem` - Monster fighting, damage calculation
- `BoardValidator` - Win/loss conditions, rule validation
- `UpgradeSystem` - Effect application and stacking
- `ClueGenerator` - Probabilistic hint generation

#### 4. **Data Layer Abstraction**
Create explicit data access patterns:
```typescript
interface GameRepository {
  saveGame(state: GameState): void
  loadGame(): GameState | null
  getCharacterData(id: string): Character
}
```

**Benefits**: Future persistence, save/load functionality, data migration strategies

---

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### üöÄ Optimization Opportunities

#### 1. **Canvas Rendering Pipeline**
Current renderer redraws entire board on every change. Consider:
- Dirty rectangle tracking
- Layer-based rendering (static board, dynamic overlays)
- RequestAnimationFrame batching
- Sprite caching for repeated icons

#### 2. **State Mutation Patterns**
Heavy object cloning in store operations. Consider:
- Immutable data structures (Immer.js integration)
- Selective state updates
- Memoization for expensive calculations

#### 3. **DOM Manipulation**
Clue panels rebuild entire DOM tree on updates. Consider:
- Virtual DOM or DOM diffing
- Event delegation instead of per-element listeners
- CSS-driven state transitions

---

## SCALABILITY ARCHITECTURE

### üìà Future Growth Patterns

#### 1. **Plugin Architecture**
Design for extensibility:
```typescript
interface GamePlugin {
  name: string
  initialize(context: GameContext): void
  onTileReveal?(tile: Tile): void
  onCombat?(monster: Monster, player: Player): void
}
```

**Enables**: Community content, A/B testing, modular features

#### 2. **Serialization Strategy**
Prepare for save/load, replay, networking:
- All game state must be serializable JSON
- Separate derived state from core state
- Command pattern for undoable actions
- Deterministic RNG with seeds

#### 3. **Multi-Board Architecture**
Current single-board model limits game modes:
```typescript
interface Campaign {
  boards: BoardConfig[]
  meta: CampaignMeta
  progression: ProgressionRules
}
```

**Enables**: Story campaigns, daily challenges, tournament modes

## DATA STRUCTURE CONCERNS

### üóÇÔ∏è Type System Evolution

#### Current Issues:
- `any` types used in event handlers (type safety erosion)
- Tile system overloaded (owner + content + state + UI concerns)
- Store state deeply nested (performance implications)

#### Recommended Changes:

```typescript
// Current: Monolithic tile with mixed concerns
interface Tile {
  // Core game data
  x: number, y: number, owner: TileOwner, content: TileContent
  // UI state (should be separate)
  annotated: string, highlighted: boolean
  // Derived state (should be computed)
  revealed: boolean, contentVisible: boolean
}

// Better: Separate concerns
interface CoreTile {
  position: Position
  owner: TileOwner  
  content: TileContent
  revealed: boolean
}

interface TileUIState {
  annotation: Annotation
  highlight: HighlightType | null
}

interface TileMetadata {
  detectorScan?: ScanResult
  chainData?: ChainConstraint
}
```

## GAME DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

### üéÆ Architecture Impact on Gameplay

#### Current Limitations:
1. **AI System**: Single DumbAI class limits strategic depth
2. **Board Generation**: Procedural but not parameterizable for different game modes
3. **Progression**: Linear difficulty scaling, no branching paths
4. **Balance**: No analytics or telemetry for data-driven tuning

#### Architectural Solutions:
1. **AI Framework**: Strategy pattern with difficulty scaling, behavior trees
2. **Level Design**: Template system with parameters, community content support
3. **Progression Trees**: Graph-based advancement, multiple victory conditions  
4. **Analytics Layer**: Event tracking, balance metrics, A/B testing hooks

---

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### üéØ Next Developer Should:

1. **Set up testing**: Jest + Testing Library, aim for 70%+ coverage of game logic
2. **Performance audit**: Bundle analysis, runtime profiling, identify bottlenecks
3. **Store refactoring**: Extract one subdomain at a time (start with UIState)
4. **Type safety**: Eliminate `any` types, add strict TypeScript config
5. **Error handling**: Add comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback

### üìä Success Metrics:

- **Performance**: <100ms state update cycles, <16ms render frames
- **Maintainability**: <500 lines per file, >80% type coverage  
- **Testing**: >70% unit test coverage, E2E test suite
- **Bundle**: <500KB compressed bundle size

## PHILOSOPHICAL NOTES

### üß≠ Architectural Philosophy

This codebase successfully demonstrates **evolutionary architecture** - starting with a working monolith and gradually extracting modules while maintaining functionality. This approach reduced risk and allowed for learning the domain before making structural decisions.

The current state is a **good foundation** for the next phase of growth. The hardest problems (game mechanics, rendering, user interaction) are solved. What remains is primarily engineering discipline: testing, performance, and maintainability.

**Resist the urge to rewrite from scratch.** The existing code works, has been battle-tested through refactoring, and encodes significant domain knowledge. Evolution over revolution.

### üöÄ Vision for the Future

This architecture can support:
- **Multiplayer**: Event-driven design translates well to networked games
- **Mobile**: Canvas rendering and touch events are mobile-ready
- **Modding**: Plugin architecture enables community content
- **Analytics**: Event system provides telemetry hooks
- **Accessibility**: Component architecture enables screen reader support

The technical foundation exists. What's needed now is **systematic improvement** rather than dramatic restructuring.
